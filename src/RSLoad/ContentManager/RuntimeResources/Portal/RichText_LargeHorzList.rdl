                                  <Value>       But here is an artist.  He desires to paint you the dreamiest,
                  shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all
                  the valley of the Saco.  What is the chief element he employs?  There
                  stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a
                  crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his
                  cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke.  Deep into
                  distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of
                  mountains bathed in their hill-side blue.  But though the picture
                  lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs
                  like leaves upon this shepherd's head, yet all were vain, unless the
                  shepherd's eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him.  Go visit
                  the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade
                  knee-deep among Tiger-lilies--what is the one charm
                  wanting?--Water--there is not a drop of water there!  Were Niagara
                  but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see
                  it?  Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two
                  handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he
                  sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway
                  Beach?  Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy
                  soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?  Why upon your
                  first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical
                  vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of
                  sight of land?  Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy?  Why did
                  the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove?  Surely
                  all this is not without meaning.  And still deeper the meaning of
                  that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the
                  tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and
                  was drowned.  But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and
                  oceans.  It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this</Value>

                  Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall,
                  northward.  What do you see?--Posted like silent sentinels all around
                  the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean
                  reveries.  Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the
                  pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some
                  high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better
                  seaward peep.  But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in
                  lath and plaster--tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to
                  desks.  How then is this?  Are the green fields gone?  What do they

                                  <Value>            Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome
                  exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck.  For as in this world,
                  head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if
                  you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the
                  Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from
                  the sailors on the forecastle.  He thinks he breathes it first; but
                  not so.  In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in
                  many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect
                  it.  But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea
                  as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a
                  whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who
                  has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and
                  influences me in some unaccountable way--he can better answer than
                  any one else.  And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage,
                  formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a
                  long time ago.  It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo
                  between more extensive performances.  I take it that this part of the
                  bill must have run something like this:</Value>

                  the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when
                  others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and
                  short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in
                  farces--though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I
                  recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the
                  springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under
                  various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did,
                  besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting
                  from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.</Value>
